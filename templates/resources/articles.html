            <h2 class="subtitle">What Classifies as Violence?</h2>
            <p class="text">Violence can take many forms. It is not always visible or physical - it can also be emotional, digital, sexual, or financial. Recognizing the different types of violence is an important step toward understanding your situation and seeking help. Below you can read about the most common forms of violence that women may experience.</p>
            <p class="header">Physical Violence</p>
             <p class="text">Physical violence includes any act that causes bodily harm or pain. This can involve hitting, slapping, kicking, strangling, pushing, or using objects or weapons to cause injury. Even if the bruises fade, the fear and trauma can remain for a long time.</p>
            <p class="header">Psychological Violence</p>
             <p class="text">Psychological (or emotional) violence can be just as damaging as physical harm. It involves actions that humiliate, intimidate, control, or isolate you. Examples include constant criticism, threats, manipulation, name-calling, or being cut off from friends and family. Over time, psychological violence can deeply affect your self-esteem and sense of safety.</p>
            <p class="header">Digital Violence</p>
             <p class="text">Digital violence happens through technology - for example, through mobile phones, social media, or online platforms. It can include threats, harassment, stalking, spreading private photos or information, or monitoring your online activity without consent. No one has the right to control or shame you online.</p>
            <p class="header">Sexual Violence and Rape</p>
             <p class="text">Sexual violence includes any sexual act or behavior that happens without your consent. This can range from unwanted touching to rape. Being in a relationship or marriage does not mean you must give consent. Everyone has the right to decide over their own body - always.</p>
            <p class="header">Stalking</p>
            <p class="text">Stalking involves repeated, unwanted attention that makes you feel unsafe or afraid. It can include following you, sending persistent messages, showing up uninvited, or monitoring your movements. Stalking is a serious violation of your freedom and privacy.</p>
             <p class="header">Material Violence</p>
             <p class="text">Material violence means damaging or destroying things that belong to you - for example, breaking your phone, tearing up your clothes, or damaging your home or car. It’s often used as a way to intimidate, threaten, or control you.</p>
            <p class="header">Economic Violence</p>
             <p class="text">Economic violence occurs when someone controls or restricts your access to money, employment, or financial decisions. This can include taking your income, denying you access to joint accounts, or preventing you from working. Financial control is a form of abuse that aims to make you dependent and powerless.</p>
            <p class="header">You Are Not Alone</p>
             <p class="text">If you recognize any of these forms of violence in your life, remember that none of it is your fault. Help and support are available on this website. Everyone deserves to feel safe, respected, and free.</p>
