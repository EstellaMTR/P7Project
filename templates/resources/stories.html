            <p class="text">For years, Maya believed that love meant endurance. She learned to read moods like weather forecasts — the shift in his eyes, the tension in his voice. She told herself he didn’t mean it, that stress made him angry, that she could fix things if she just tried harder. The apologies always came after — soft words, promises, gifts that couldn’t hide the bruises underneath. </p>
            <p class="text">She stopped seeing her friends, stopped answering her mother’s calls. Little by little, the world around her shrank until it was only him — his rules, his temper, his silence. She began to doubt her own memory, her own worth. Fear became a quiet companion, sitting beside her at dinner, waiting in the dark when the key turned in the lock. </p>
            <p class="text">The moment she decided to leave wasn’t loud or violent. It came one morning, while she watched the sun rise through the window. She realized she hadn’t felt sunlight without fear in years. Something inside her shifted — a small, steady voice whispered, You deserve to be safe. That voice carried her through the hardest part: calling for help, packing a bag, stepping out the door. Her hands shook, but her feet moved forward.</p>
            <p class="text">The first days were hard. There were tears, doubts, nightmares. But there was also kindness — the counselor who listened without judgment, the friend who offered a couch, the support group that reminded her she wasn’t alone. Slowly, she began to breathe again.</p>
            <p class="text">Now, months later, Maya still has scars, but they no longer define her. She’s learning that healing isn’t about forgetting — it’s about reclaiming. She fills her space with music, with laughter, with people who see her as she is: strong, brave, free.</p>
            <p class="text">Every morning, she opens the curtains and lets the light in. The sunlight feels like a promise — that life after violence is not only possible, but worth every step it takes to reach it.</p>
